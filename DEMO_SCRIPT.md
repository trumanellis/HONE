## Recording Tips

1. **Use a real example** - Generate a simple landing page with Claude, save as HTML
2. **Pre-stage your edits** - Know exactly what you'll change before recording
3. **Hide your cursor when not clicking** - Cleaner look
4. **Speed up the typing** - 1.5-2x on text entry keeps it snappy
5. **Add subtle zoom** - Zoom into the element you're editing
6. **Background music** - Lo-fi or ambient, very low volume

## Quick GIF Version (15 sec)

For README/Twitter, just show:
1. Drag file onto HONE (2 sec)
2. Click and edit headline (4 sec)
3. Right-click → Replace Image (4 sec)
4. Cmd+S save (2 sec)
5. End card with URL (3 sec)

No audio needed - the action speaks for itself.
